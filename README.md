# GessDotPie
this is going to be just the normal gess.py but in a Discord bot shape and form, it will also include stuff form PythonPr like hilo and others, i was thinking of making an auto GitHub commit bot but that requires me to learn both libraries and its just too much for me, here is a short summary of all commands (atm):

/admingivemoney --- This command can be only used by admins (obviously) but it allows an admint to give any amount of money they want, from thin air.

/admintakemoney --- This also needs to be used by admins to take money from players, this will come in hand sometimes.

/balance --- view your OWN balance

/leaderboard --- view the leaderboard money-wise

/roll --- Usage: this is a gambling game where you gamble your money that an admin (or a fellow admin) gave you, to use this type /roll then you can select the amount /roll amount:(10k, 10m,100000, 1b etc ) letters after numbers CAN be accepted like k, m and b and you choose a target /roll amount: (eg 3m) target: (3-97, higher risk higher reward) you will further understand the target when explaining the choice, choice /roll amount: (eg 3m) target: (3-97) choice:(over/under) so if you chose your target to be 50 for example and chose under, a dice from 1-100 will roll, and if the number was under (because you chose under) your target 50, you will win, if it was equal or over 50, you lose

# Commands to be added:

/hilo - further explaination when added,
